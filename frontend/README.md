# 🅿️ Smart Parking Detection System – AI-Powered Parking Occupancy Predictor

A deep learning–based **Smart Parking System** built using **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and the PKLot dataset. This project predicts whether a parking space is **occupied** or **empty** using a CNN-based image classifier — now enhanced with a **real-time video-based detection module** using **OpenCV**, enabling live monitoring through video streams or CCTV feeds.

## 📊 Model Workflow

### 🧹 Preprocessing

* Load images from `PKLotSegmented`
* Resize images (typically to 54×32 or similar)
* Normalize pixel values
* Split into train/test sets

### 🧠 Model Architecture

* 3 Conv2D + MaxPooling layers
* Dense layers with Dropout
* Sigmoid output for binary classification

### 📈 Evaluation

* Accuracy, precision, recall
* Confusion matrix
* Visual prediction examples
